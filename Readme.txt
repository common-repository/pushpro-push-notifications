== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Check out our [FAQ page](https://pushpro.io/docs) to find answers to all your questions. 
The list below will provide answers to your most pressing questions:

*How am I going to be billed?*

You will be charged on a recurring basis, either monthly or yearly. We collect your payment details when you select your first paid plan. 
After each successful charge, we will send you a billing receipt. Check your user account profile to see your latest and upcoming invoices.

*Do my subscribers need a mobile app to use PushPro?*

No, they don’t! The great thing about PushPro is that we send web-based push notifications. Once a visitor to your website has opted in to push notifications, 
they get sent to them straight from your website, no mobile app needed. 

*How do I send a push notification?*

You can send a push notification in a few easy steps. Select the domain you want to send push notifications from. Next up, go to “notifications” in the sidebar menu and follow the steps to create a push notification. Give your notification a name, provide it with a message title, body text, destination URL and a button text.
In step two you can provide the notification with a Time to Live and a vibration pattern
You can preview the notification by pressing “Test Now”. Finally, save the notification as a draft, schedule the notification or send it directly.

*What happens if I exceed my plan’s subscriber limit?*

We will notify you when you reach 50%, 80% and 100% of your plan’s subscriber limit, so you will have plenty of time to consider an upgrade. We will send you an alert in your user profile to make sure you are always up to speed.
If you do hit the 100% limit, we will still register new subscribers for a limited period. However, you won’t be able to send them push notifications. 
When you upgrade your plan, these ‘sleeping’ subscribers will be reactivated.
